/**
 * Publish an IG instance's SERVED directories into its own built site.
 *
 * On the main site `mount-instance-docs.ts` publishes every `served: true`
 * directory at `/<instance>/<path>`. An IG repository's OWN site
 * (`templates/ig-repo-site/folio-site.yml`) is that instance alone, at the
 * site root, and copied exactly one served directory by hand —
 * `fhir-artifact-index`. Every other one was missing, and the first casualty
 * was the `openapi` graph: smart-trust's pages link `openapi/index.html`
 * (deep links `#/<tag>/<operationId>` too), which `gen-openapi-pages` writes
 * into that graph, and 43 links on smart-trust's gh-pages led nowhere
 * (measured 2026-10-09). Owner, same day: *"openapi fix links so point to new
 * openapi render pipeline"*.
 *
 * So the list is READ from the declaration, never written in the workflow: a
 * served directory declared later is published without anyone editing a
 * workflow in every IG repository.
 *
 * Verbatim, like the main site's mount: no Liquid, no layout. A destination
 * that already exists in the built site is REFUSED, not merged — the site
 * already publishes something at that URL, and two answers for one URL is the
 * defect `mount-instance-docs` refuses for the same reason.
 *
 * Usage (from the folio-assistant checkout, after `jekyll build`):
 *   bun run fhir-harness/scripts/publish-served.ts --instance <name> --site <built site>
 *
 * @module fhir-harness/scripts/publish-served
